## 👋 Hey, I'm Misab A R  
An undergraduate student of **Electronics and Communication Engineering** at **RV College of Engineering, Bengaluru**.  
\
I’m passionate about `digital design`, `linux`, `foss`, `self-hosting`, `racing` 🏎️, and all things `tech`.  

My hobbies are reading, watching f1, cycling, and running.

I'm also a bit paranoid about security and privacy.\
Google is definitely watching, listening and tracking you 👀

I try to self host what i can,  so shout out to Immich and Vaultwarden, I truly couldn't live without these amazing projects.

I break my system at least once a month (on purpose, of course). `i use arch, btw`

This website was made with :heart: using blowfish!

I'll be writing about the various stupid stuff i experiment with, so join along the journey

## 🧑‍💻 About Me (Portfolio)
I’m a second-year **ECE student** with hands-on experience in embedded systems, real-time operating systems, and digital chip design.  
I thrive at the intersection of hardware and software — from **low-level microcontroller programming** to **RTL architecture** and **Linux ecosystems**.  

When I’m not tinkering with boards or debugging code, I’m probably experimenting with **self-hosted services**, or dismantling a perfectly working object


## 🛠️ Skills  

- **Programming Languages**: C, C++, ARM Thumb2, Python, Verilog, Dockerfile, Docker Compose  
- **Microcontrollers**: STM32F4xx, ESP32, Arduino, ARM Cortex M0+, Raspberry Pi 4  
- **Development Tools**: STM32CubeIDE, Keil µVision, Docker, Kubernetes, Git, ROS2, Rviz, Gazebo, Vivado
