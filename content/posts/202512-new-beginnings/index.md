## The idea
So basically I've gotten some really useful information from other's blogs and articles and 
just thought **why not make my own?**


It also serves as a place where 
- I can share all my ideas, experiments and stupid projects to the whole world
- I can refer back to later, when I eventually forget how I did something

## This Website
And thus this website was born!! 
> I also needed a portfolio, soo two birds with one stone


Yes it’s still a work in progress, but it was super easy to set up all thanks to the Hugo framework and the Blowfish theme, all I really need to do now is keep adding `content` :smiling_face_with_tear:

There’s also an RSS feed for the blog that you can subscribe, to automatically get my future posts, using an [rss reader](https://github.com/ReadYouApp/ReadYou) ( if you're into that stuff :upside_down_face:)

```md
https://crypticnoodle.work/posts/index.xml
```

## Future??

Well ideally, I’ll manage to write and format everything I want to share, and post it here ~*frequently*~

`"Ideally"`

*lmao*

We’ll see how often I actually post — no guarantees — but I do have some pretty cool stuff planned. So stick around, subscribe to the RSS feed, or follow me on Instagram because I’ll probably drop a story whenever I publish something new.

And hey, feel free to leave suggestions or even send PRs to fix my typos and questionable grammar :)
